However, some changes have been recommended to make the app more efficient and effective.

The following will be accomplished to take the new app to the next level:
* Adding the weather description to the weather data;
* To enable beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels;
* To enable beta tester to choose four cities to create a travel itinerary;
* Lastly, use Google Maps Directions API, to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

The tourist or any oher visitor can tour the selected cities by car. We managed to select 4 cities in the United States of America (USA) namely Mango,Laguna, Winslow and Kingsville. The circle, as shown in the map, is the itinerrary while driving , to demonstrate the convenience and proximity of the four cities.


After that, a marker is drwn and show describing the four cities and their details in terms of available hotels, country, city, max temperature and the weather description, right on the app. The grap below show the dynamics.
